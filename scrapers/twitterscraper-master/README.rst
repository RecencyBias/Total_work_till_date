Synopsis
========

A simple script to scrape for Tweets using the Python package requests to retrieve the content and
Beautifullsoup4 to parse the retrieved content.

Motivation
==========

Twitter has provided `REST API's <https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public>`__ which can be used by
developers to access and read Twitter data. They have also provided a `Streaming
API <https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview>`__ which can be used to access Twitter Data in
real-time.

Most of the software written to access Twitter data provide a library which functions as a wrapper
around Twitters Search and Streaming API's and therefore are limited by the limitations of the
API's.

With Twitter's Search API you can only sent 180 Requests every 15 minutes. With a maximum number of
100 tweets per Request this means you can mine for 4 x 180 x 100 = 72.000 tweets per hour. By using
TwitterScraper you are not limited by this number but by your internet speed/bandwith and the number
of instances of TwitterScraper you are willing to start.

One of the bigger disadvantages of the Search API is that you can only access Tweets written in the
**past 7 days**. This is a major bottleneck for anyone looking for older past data to make a model
from. With TwitterScraper there is no such limitation.

Installation
============

To install **twitterscraper**:

.. code:: python

    (sudo) pip install twitterscraper

or you can clone the repository and in the folder containing setup.py

.. code:: python

    python setup.py install

The CLI
=======

You can use the command line application to get your tweets stored to JSON right away:

``twitterscraper "Trump OR Clinton" --limit 100 --output=tweets.json``

Omit the limit to retrieve all tweets. You can at any time abort the scraping by pressing Ctrl+C,
the scraped tweets will be stored safely in your JSON file.

Code Example
============

You can easily use TwitterScraper from within python:

.. code:: python

    from twitterscraper import query_tweets


    # All tweets matching either Trump or Clinton will be returned. You will get at
    # least 10 results within the minimal possible time/number of requests
    for tweet in query_tweets("Trump OR Clinton", 10)[:10]:
        print(tweet.user.encode('utf-8'))

You can use any advanced query twitter supports. Simply compile your query at
https://twitter.com/search-advanced.

You should get an output like this:

.. code:: text

TO DO
=====

-  Add caching potentially? Would be nice to be able to resume scraping if something goes wrong and
   have half of the data of a request cached or so.
-  Add an example of using a thread pool/asynchio for gathering more tweets in parallel.
