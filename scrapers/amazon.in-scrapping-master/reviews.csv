4.0 , 15 July 2016,Just got it and the first thing i did was to benchmark it. But first I would like to clarify some things about the product :1. All the different sizes available from 16 GB to 128 GB will have similar Write and Read Speed.2. The only difference between the 48 mbps and the 80 mbps models is that in 80 mbps model of each size you will get an adapter. Yeah That's it.It works great like any sandisk product. Its quality is premium.The read and write speed avg. I got is 20 Mega Byte per second and 16 Mega Byte per second respectively. Keep in mind these speeds are valid for all 16-128 gb sizes and 48 mbps product or the 80 mbps product. If you want faster read and write speeds certainly go for uhs-1 or above. Class 10 is for media consumption and upto 1080p recording. If you want to record 4K just don't go with this product.I am listing a few products if you want higher Speeds like for 4K :<a class="a-link-normal" href="/SanDisk-Extreme-32GB-microSDHC-UHS-1-Card-with-Adapter-SDSQXNE-032G-GN6MA-Newest-Version/dp/B013CP5HCK">SanDisk Extreme 32GB microSDHC UHS-1 Card with Adapter (SDSQXNE-032G-GN6MA) [Newest Version</a>]<a class="a-link-normal" href="/SanDisk-Extreme-64GB-MicroSDXC-UHS-1-Card-with-Adapter-SDSQXNE-064G-GN6MA-Newest-Version/dp/B013CP5IWO">SanDisk Extreme 64GB MicroSDXC UHS-1 Card with Adapter (SDSQXNE-064G-GN6MA) [Newest Version</a>]

1.0 , 15 July 2016,This card is giving more trouble, in a month it became headache for me, it is unmounted any time...
1.0 , 15 July 2016,Not working for me.
2.0 , 7 May 2016,This card is big time waste of money i dunno why this manufacturers claim of 48mb/s n bla bla bla.... when i tested this cards they are not giving speed more than 14mb writing and 16-18mb reading speed then from where they claim 40mb and 48mb??? Dont waste ur money in this... u will surely regret.
1.0 , 13 March 2016,After 4 months the SD card is not working properly . Nothing can be deleted and nothing can be copied.The warranty  is not even available in India.

1.0 , 14 July 2016,Worked only for 2 months. Was fitted to my Moto G3. After 2 months it mentioned memory card missing. I reinserted it, still didn't read. Inserted to my laptop through adapter but it didn't read at all. Had to discard it. I lost all my data stored in it.10 years warranty is mentioned, but how it works no idea. Will it be replaced by any means?
1.0 , 26 April 2016,The product is good to copy from PC through adapter, but it doesn't work well with my Lumia 650. Without the memory card everything is perfect but after inserting it, problem starts.1)The phone restarts automatically.2)can't open file explorer and storage app3)whatsapp download crashingI removed it, formatted it, and re inserted in phone. Connected the phone through USB cable to the PC and started copying the files. And after a while it stopped responding.I am going to try other normal techniques and if the problem still exists, then I will go for a refund !!!Formatted it completely and changed the allocation size from 16 to 32.Though it took another hour to set everything, it did work properly for some time and now its not responding.I have been using sandisk products for the last 8 years and this is the first time I am getting issues like this.The phone is perfect without this memory card....
4.0 , 21 January 2016,Good product... ordered "Upto 48 Mbps Read Speed" @269/- on 16th Jan and received it within 3 days.Connected to Win 10 with Sandisk SD Card AdapterFormatted the card as NTFSFile transferred: The Martiansize: 2.18 GbWrite speed: 13.8 Mbps (2 min 44 sec)Read speed: 24.1 Mbps (1 min 33 sec) (failed to get more than 25mbps on any transfer)
5.0 , 30 June 2016,I've used different memory cards over the years but SanDisk is the name I will suggest to anyone willing to buy a Memory Card or a Pen Drive.REVIEW (after using the card for three days):==================================1) The product comes in a thin but tough packaging, like advertised. In it, you get the Memory Card (Micro SDHC) + a Micro SDHC to SDHC adapter that helps you use the memory card with your Laptop, DSLR Cameras, etc. Product is as advertised on this page.2) With the 16 GB variant of this Micro SD card, you get nearly 15 GB of usable free space for usage.3) It works great with Moto G4 Plus smartphone without problems. I tried recording a Full HD video on the mobile phone and the fact that there was no problem or delay in recording / saving of the video to the card proves that it is indeed a Class 10 UHC 1 Micro SD card.4) Images capture on the mobile phone get saved on the card in an instant; as fast as it gets saved in the mobile phone's inbuilt memory.5) There was a promotional "Hungama" app Pro account trial code on the top portion of the package (scratch to reveal type), which I successfullyactivated and updated in the app (followed the instructions provided).CONS:======Mentioning only "80 MB/s" data transfer speed in the description is misleading / in-complete information. It should read "80 MB/s READ speed" in the description itself, rather than having us read the entire description below to find that out.NOTE:------------At this time, I haven't been able to benchmark the card's performance. Also, I haven't been able to use the adapter that came with with the card. I'll test them both at the earliest, and when I have the results, I'll make sure to update this review (as usual).VERDICT:=========So far, the card has performed really well and there's no doubt it is a genuine SanDisk Micro SD card. Go for it!
4.0 , 30 November 2015,I purchased this Card to use with my Oneplu X mobile... but due to some technical problems.. the phone failed to accept the MicroSD card.. Today i received their latest OTA update.. and ..wow..the card listed on the phone and can easily store ,play music and video files... even installed apps can be moved to this card.. Love it... No visible lag if you play an HD clip from the Card...Thanks SanDisk..Thanks amazon...
5.0 , 4 June 2016,It is 32 Gb version write speed 80mbps ie more then 10 mbps. . Read speed arround 32MBps ... Hungary offer is not valid now on this card. It is Uhs class 1 and otherwise class 10 card . It is good enough for normal read write operations for camera nd android devices. 10 year warranty is bonus for this... if you want to test read write speed download any sd card benchmark tool from Google or app store.Nice card it's 16 Gb variety and 32  Gb variety both are great . Other capacites I have not tried. But you can go for this card if you need to expand your capacity. Before that please ensure your mobile supports the max capacity otherwise either it will not detect the card or will only only limited no of files on your device...Have happy memories....Deepak
1.0 , 21 May 2016,The transfer speed is well below what was promised to me. And worst still it keeps stuttering. While video recording on my phone it starts and stops frequently. But what can i do, i am pocket conscious average Indian who can't help but be content with it!!!!!!!
4.0 , 21 April 2016,The product is good it shows approx 63 GB free of 64 GB. I dont know why do they shows the copying speed is 48 mbps its near 10 to 12 mbps but its fast cool. good deal in this range because samsung and strontium are selling it on high cost 64 GB is only for the mobile lovers who clicked hd photos and videos from mobile. the people who gathered all the data like muvies songs etc in a single chip so u can get this card. If u r looking for the standard space so you should go for 32 GB or 16 GB  card but always use class 10 memory card because its faster than any of your memorycard they are xray proof magnetic proof shock proof water proof as well so conclusion is buy the card acording to your usage but buy only class10
1.0 , 4 December 2015,Not working properly. For the first few days it was perfect. After that it has not working properly. When I try to charge up my mobile SD card is removed unexpectedly all the time. First I think it was mobile problem then later only I realized the problem is not with my mobile, it is in SD card. Adapter also not working. When I m trying to return it also not possible because return time of 10days re already over.
3.0 , 15 June 2016,This product's page on amazon shows MRP as ₹7,900 and after discount ₹3,000. I bought it for ₹3000, good deal. But behind the package the MRP is ₹4,000. The MRP is artificially raised from 4k to 8k so that the deal looks attractive.
4.0 , 28 October 2015,I bought SanDisk 32gb micro SD it is very good &amp;totally original card thanks to Amazon. In.But 32gb SD card space 28.8gb Show that's is why I don't understand 28gb Show???? And MY rating ****
5.0 , 27 February 2016,I ordered SanDisk 32 GB last week from Cloudtail, a very big seller. I was shocked to see a duplicate memory card which was actually Taiwan made with fake serial numbers delivered. The packing and seal looked genuine enough to deceive even a trained eye. The memory card showed 29.8 GB free on insertion, but the actual space was mere 6 MB when tested on software, returned it. Cloudtail seller, please be aware or else your hard earned money will go in drain and risk damaging your device.
5.0 , 10 August 2015,It,s Amazing. no more create additional temp file...... &amp; get very fast transfer  to file.
3.0 , 25 October 2015,The Read speed mention in the photo is not true it can only go upto 48mbps and that is the reading speed writing speed would be much more slowe r than that.And this is the link where i came to know about this.https://www.sandisk.in/home/memory-cards/microsd-cards/ultra-microsd
2.0 , 8 January 2016,I was looking forward to use it as a memory card for my phone as well as a USB device but all my expectations were shattered by the low writing speed (results are attached as an image) which is not stable. Once I even got an extremely low writing speed of 800KB/sec while transferring a file of 50 MB. And from time to time, it leads to a 'Not responding' on my PC while browsing through the files. SanDisk failed to deliver their 'regular' standards in this product.
1.0 , 7 May 2016,Delivered on Time. After some days write speed and read speed reduced. I got the write speed around 4MB/sec and write speed to 20MB/sec. Don't buy this product. I bought this product to use in phone, due to decreasing writing and reading my phone some times get very slow . I hate this product .
4.0 , 8 October 2015,Write speed is about 10.5MB/s and read is 22 MB/s using CrystalDiskMark on PC and on android different apps showing different results. SDtools show 35MB/s write &amp; 41MB/s read, while A1bench shows nearly what the PC application showed. Little over priced as compared to the 48MB/s ones but I think there wont be any noticeable difference. Using for SWAP.
4.0 , 20 April 2016,product is good. speed sufficient to copy and transfer file. very fast memory card. must buy.see this link which will be helpful for you for future purchase[...][...][...][...]
3.0 , 6 March 2016,I was a bit sceptic after reading reviews about memory cards that are purchased online..Some say it does not have arrow on it.Some say that storage capacity of these cards are far less than what's written on it.But,I have checked card's storage capacity by copying almost 14.5 GB movies on card and pasting that in another computer. All movies ran fully.Copying speed is almost good as claimed..(though i did not checked it on h2testw)..I can recommend this product.After using it for few days in found its speed to be a bit less.  Users May opt upto 80mbps speed card..
1.0 , 20 June 2016,The memory card is unexpectedely removed all the times...I have to manually re insert in the phone..At first I thought it's my phone defect..later observed that there is fault in the card
1.0 , 8 June 2016,I received a defective product. The sd card gets unmount automatically again and again. First I thought that it may be the handset issue but the same issue exists in other handset too.
5.0 , 10 March 2016,i ordered this product  for my dad but initiall it used get disconnected on and off ... i tested this for 1 day and also found the same ...i returned the product via amazon very smoothly ... and i got an another piece of SanDisk ultra 32 gb  which is superb and working so well...Thanks amazon team !!
1.0 , 21 November 2015,Speed promised is upto 80mbps; but it never crossed 10mbps... seems to be a waste of money.
4.0 , 19 October 2015,As Its is Not UHS-I sd Card .

4.0 , 13 October 2015,Good product and delivery. I got it for Rs.323/- only. Go for it. speed given is not correct. While coping data it show 12-13 mb/sec. But it doesnt matter. Overall its a good deal.
5.0 , 25 January 2016,super product, it helps me a lot, its a super product, the price was pretty cheap.it helps me to store pictures, movies, and song and play many games on my samsung galaxy j5
1.0 , 22 May 2016,Very bad Product.....After first format..... its capacity reduces from 16GB to 2GB........ Now it is 2GB memory card...... it is totally fake product..... don't buy this.
4.0 , 12 April 2016,It does what it says. Large files of about 1 gb can be easily copied in under a minute.When compared to class 4 memory cards, they take 4-5 minutes for the same.High speed, good storage, and at a great price for around 300 bucks. And to top it all off, the brand of SanDisk!! Couldn't ask for better. Always buy sandisk, never buy transcend. Earlier I used to use transcend, and all the memory cards(3) got corrupted within a few months of use. Then one my friends advised me to use sandisk, and I have never been disappointed
1.0 , 19 June 2016,Some times it shows that....media card has been removed...n after dat it doesn't work in cell phone...then need to reinsert  d card again...Its really irritating.....
5.0 , 15 September 2015,Have been using the product on a lumia device for the past 5 days, and it's very good. There's nothing much to say about this as everyone personally uses these. Speeds are very good, more than what you actually need, be it for windows devices or android ones. The new good thing is they now come with 7 year warranty instead of the initial 5. And believe me, warranty provided by sandisk is very good. Call them, get RMA approved, submit the product and they courier the replacement back to you.Highly recommended!!!
4.0 , 29 February 2016,This Micro SD Card of Class 10 is probably the best in the market. It gives flawless performance and ultimate satisfaction. The reading and writing speed is decent and you hardly feel any lag while copying stuffs to and fro from a mobile phone. This is the fourth purchase of Sandisk SD Card and like all the other cards, this have had satisfied me. I really do not have any negative comments, but, the colour of the card, ie, white/grey impression turns of get scratched easily.My advice - Just buy it!
4.0 , 26 February 2016,It's been good so far. No problem with the delivery..
1.0 , 9 June 2016,Fully fault item sold by amazon. The memory card is automatically dismounted by mobile. This happens in every mobile I checked. Please tell me how to claim warranty.
2.0 , 26 December 2015,Since I am using this memory card. After few hours I am unable to use the apps, songs and picture/videos stored in the memory card. It starts giving me error "unable to open file",or "media not available". Then I have to restart my phone.. After restarting it gives me error, "SD card damaged try formatting" I have to restart my phone again. After restarting it twice or thrice, it works fine but issue starts again in few hours or minutes. I want to return this product. Please help.
1.0 , 18 May 2016,Worked well for a couple of months.then suddenly sd card started getting unmounted. Tried everything but no use lost all my data. Worst experience worst product.
1.0 , 18 May 2016,It is not working as expected .. i haven been using ultra memory cards .. from long time . And it is working very slow as compare to myvother memory cards  .....
5.0 , 8 March 2016,Great product at a great Price!I got what I was looking for. Been using it since around 10 days. Being located a bit farther, I was expecting the delivery to be delayed, however the  delivery was well much before time.So far very good. I haven't observed anything abnormal with this SD card. I use it in My Samasung Galaxy Tab E. It works perfectly fine.I would recommend this product to everyone. If you are planning for an SD Card in this capacity range, go for it.
1.0 , 30 March 2016,Bad Product. Its very Slow. The speed mentioned there is not the real speed. ''WRITE' Speed' is 9-10 Mbps and ''READ' Speed' is 35-38 Mbps. Very Very poor card.
5.0 , 10 March 2016,A price drop in the class 10 category Micro SDHC prompted me to purchase this item. This item costed 4 times the price when I was in the market for a 32 GB card
3.0 , 16 February 2016,It is good only for high end devices...I used it in Moto e1,2-moto G1,2-Asus zenphone 2. In all devices I am getting warning as "SD card removed unexpectedly" and only option remains is to reinsert cardSo while purchasing card for phones please take a look at class of the card and your device supportability.5 stars for card as I am sure it would work smoothly in my digicam. 1 star since I purchased for mobile so avg 3 star. Its not card defect but its mobile compatibility thing.....
5.0 , 20 October 2015,This SanDisk memory card is a complete value for money purchase. I bought it for Rs. 316 (discount offer) and it works amazingly fine with my android phones.
1.0 , 10 June 2016,purchased this product 5 months ago it has great read and write speed but now it has stopped working something went wrong with it can't even format it now !
4.0 , 24 January 2016,Ordering the SD card was easy and delivery was prompt as well. But I do have a formal complaint regarding the person who came to deliver the product. I was not at home the day when the product was supposed to be delivered, I was no able to attend the phone calls. Though the complete address was clearly mentioned on the account and landmark was also mentioned. The person came to deliver the product literally mis-behaved with my parents. I believe such incident wont be repeated again.
5.0 , 24 November 2015,Sandisk has given a excellent product, which i use for my Camera. Works as expected from a Class 10 MicroSD Card.Even though the card fits a bit loosely in the adapter, I thought it might not work but it did, but I am still afraid that it mightdrop out of the adapter unnoticed.Bought this product at a price you cannot refuse, since you cannot get such a quality product at a reasonable rate and compared to otherproducts in the market, I think this is the best.
5.0 , 12 May 2016,Have used this since the last 4 days on my Android device.Speed is noticeably faster than the standard SD card that I used before but I didnt try to compare the transfer speeds head to head. So I can't give you exact numbers. But it is definitely faster and the phone seems faster after installing this as most of my apps run from the SD card (I keep most of the apps on SD card because of storage constraints).The added adapter was a bonus. Happy with the purchase.
5.0 , 11 May 2016,Got ir for Rs 326. 4 months after purchasing it, it still works fine. Good buy and no problems so far. Amazon delivery is on par with the best, as always
1.0 , 13 June 2016,I got this product previous week and while using it in my phone(lenovo vibe p1m) i cant move files from phone memory to sd card..if done so..it gets corrupted.When tried the same using another SD card..no issues was there..Also while trying to connect it with a pc to solve the issue using a card reader..it showed that the sd card should be formated.so i tried to format it..it too failed..Didnt expect this from amazon and sandisk..Hardly disappointed..kindly inform anysolution!
3.0 , 26 November 2015,It's reading speed was said to be upto 48mb/s but practically writing speed is maximum 7.6mb/ps. It could have been better.Otherwise it's all right. :)
1.0 , 8 January 2016,Damaged product
4.0 , 21 February 2016,I purchased this memory card from Amazon, Unlike other geeks on the internet I didn't test it whether its water resistance, what is the write speed, what is the read speed bla bla, however for a simple use, this memory card is working well, the read from the mobile phone is just fine, it does not make the phone to hang, and the write is also OK. If you just want a memory card for some normal use, go for it, else pick out some other one, there are so many in the websites.
4.0 , 17 March 2016,Though the product dint met the features as stated.But yes the product is truly genuine as confirmed from SanDisk Customer Service.One has to mail pictures of front and back of the Memory card  to support@sandisk.com  and within a day or two you will receive a confirmation stating that the product is legitimate.No glitch while writing or reading functions very smooth on my Lenovo K4 Note but read speed is not as stated on the card i.e 48x.
1.0 , 10 June 2016,I didn't get any vat bill for this product &amp; also confused about warranty.its written on the back side of the cover that 5year warranty in EUROPE.
3.0 , 14 December 2015,Got it within 3 days,packaging good About product  Out of 32 gb only 28.samething free space,upload and download speed not that great,sametime i trying to copy a movie from pc it get good speed but after 50% 60% speed decreased vey bad|  My old Strontium 32gb class 10 much faster than this|......don't compare brand ,compare its quality| My Own experience Strontium much better than sandisk,i used 8 16 and 32gb product of strontium
3.0 , 27 November 2015,This Sandisk 32 GB memory card's usable memory is only nearly 28 GB.Also I using this memory card in MOTO G 2nd generation mobile. This memory card doesn't work to write files which was transferred via bluetooth and any other means. We need to send it to phone memory and then we need to move it to memory card.It is time consuming. But i don't know about how it works with other brand mobiles.But read/write speed is good as mentioned.
2.0 , 19 March 2016,Did not work at all when used as internal in Android Marshmallow.....kept on crashing.....had to switch on to "use as portable" again.
5.0 , 27 March 2016,Good product. First time I returned it as was not working. However, promptly it was exchanged. The SD card of 128 gb is worth. Thanks amazon.
5.0 , 25 February 2016,very very useful Good product  low cost item
1.0 , 28 April 2016,There is some thing wrong with it. When ever I insert it into my mobile phone.my phone gives an error message.please replace it if you can.
4.0 , 11 May 2016,As it UHS-I class 10 memory card read and write speed is good.It gives me around 41 Mbps read speed and around 20 Mbps write speed.
3.0 , 1 July 2016,After receiving this product I have done several test to check the speed pf card however I never got speed of 48 MB/s. I got reading speed of 22 MB/s and write speed up to 17 MB/s. I think 48 MB/s is wrong commitment by Sandisk.Previously I purchased strontium card but I was not readable in my redmi 1sSo I purchased sandisk. I am satisfied with this card as my mobile is reading this card quite well as compared to strontium.
5.0 , 13 February 2016,I've verified the product from Sandisk India. It's a genuine product. Available storage 58.5 GB. Read Speed 34.85MB/s and Write Speed 17.74MB/s avg. Transfer speed is good too. Recommended. Those who are going to buy, please make sure that after purchasing the product, you must verify it from Sandisk whther it's genuine or not. Sandisk CC is really helpful. It's a high speed card and Sandisk is an epitome of trustworthiness. Go for it.
5.0 , 16 March 2016,compared it side-by-side with samsung's class 10it performs way betteri went with samsung for it's warranty, now i regret it
5.0 , 22 December 2015,Gud product..delivered on time.go for it👍
5.0 , 25 November 2015,Good product. Works well with Lumia 640xl.
5.0 , 16 October 2015,this is my 4th SanDisk Ultra Card. I use GoPro Hero 4 Black which captures 4K videos and this is my go to card in a very affordable price point. It handles everything quite well and if you are looking for smartphone card or for GoPro, this is the best. Also I am using, all 4 of them together and all of them are working fine.You can find all my videos on YouTube recorded on this card if you search ride with rahul (on youtube)
4.0 , 18 May 2016,If in some device you are not able to get the permission to make changes through app which are not system default then it is due to the fact that it's encryption is exFAT insted of FAT32.You first need to install a formatting app in your computer because default formatter can't format cards bigger than 32GB in FAT32 encryption. So download the application, format the card in FAT32 encryption and it is then all set to use.
1.0 , 7 June 2016,Brought this item on a sale on Amazon.  I wanted to use this with my MI Pad, but unfortunately it does not work properly.  It suddenly stops working and the only way to make it working again, is to remove and reinsert the card.  I am using another MicroSD card with the MI Pad and that works perfectly fine without any issues.This seems like a cheap version from SanDisk, would say it is best to avoid this product.
2.0 , 22 June 2016,Product delivery was quick, packaging was fine and item looked as in description. But it was not compatible with my Samsung S3 Neo mobile and it gave frequent messages of "Card was unmounted unexpectedly..Preparing SD card". I had no problems with my earlier kingston SD card but I wanted a larger capacity so I ordered this item. As this did not come with SD card adapter, I have no other option but to return it.
3.0 , 20 December 2015,As I needed to expand the memory of my Samsung Tab 4, I purchased this card (32 GB, 80Mbps).But after trying it on laptop's SD-port, and trying some benchmark, I was upset. I tried to some movie files (around 1GB size) and copied them from PC to card and vise versa. Then tried two renowned benchmarking tool to test the card (photos attached). As evaluated by me, the crystaldiskmark is giving apt result. For larger files, the read speed is no where near 80 MBps but less than 20Mbps, and the write speed is near 20MBps.The adapter for microSD to SD was useful and delivery by Amazon was swift.VERDICT: Do not buy this product as it is highly priced (not working as advertised), instead, go for cheaper alternatives available at much lower price.
1.0 , 18 June 2016,I went for this product expecting that it has minimum warranty period ,it performed well for the first two  weeks ,after which it started showing minor hiccups  stopped working ,when I tried to return this product the site showed that this window has closed for me within 10 days into purchase  I don't understand why cant they guarantee a minimum period of at least 1month which any local market trader  will give .....
1.0 , 18 January 2016,Please do not buy this 64 GB one , specially if you have ASUS ZENfone 2 ;it get unmounted again again autometically and aagain get mounter without doing any thing , many times my fone got restarted ; apps that I moved in SD Card is wore not working properlly ; before this I was using 32GB/80MBPS card and there was  no problem and now after removing card every thing is ok again ;thanks to amazone easy return policy .
5.0 , 24 February 2016,genuine product and got 7 years warrenty for this memory card.Thank you Amazon for selling 16 GB memory card at a price of 8 GB .
5.0 , 27 November 2015,Recently I've bought this card for my windows phone (BLU WIN JR LTE) the card works perfectly even with windows phones though specified for android phone. Though I did not get 48 mbps speed (I was not even expecting to get ), It did perform most of tasks very well.All of my apps are running at a little bit more speed than if they were in internal storage.Thankyou Amazon for promoting such genuine cards
1.0 , 25 March 2016,After two months of use as part of my intern memory my moto x play judt told me that the card is damaged. I formated it (lost a lot Apps, Fotos, videos, music....). And now there is just 15.9 MB usable of the 64 GB!!!!!! Card.
1.0 , 24 June 2016,Amazon Verified PurchaseThis is a defective product I got from Amazon, this card gets automatically becomes dismount from my mobile, I checked to replace but that was not happens.I tried with other mobiles too but same problem. I believed that Amazon surely supply 100% genuine and good product after experiencing this I lost hope on Amazon. So guys please careful while buying product at discounted price .
3.0 , 11 July 2016,Upto 48 mbps is false.  I connected this card to USB Card Reader.  When I copied files from hard disk, it writes at a maximum speed of 12 mbps only.  The performance will be clearly known only after 6 months or more.  6 months back I purchased Transcend 32 GB Class 10 Micro SD Card.  Now the card shows that it is read only.  Unable to delete/copy/format the SD card.  Manufacturers are cheating the customers.
1.0 , 1 February 2016,This card has pathetic read/write speed. My 48mb/s San disk ultra card is faster than this 80mb/s card. Dont fall for it.
5.0 , 4 December 2015,Really I m so happy with this product SanDisk Ultra MicroSDHC 16GB UHS-I Class 10 Memory Card (Upto 48 MB/s Speed)***** for16 GB capacityUpto 48MB/s read speedDependable high speed for shooting Full HD video and high quality photosCompatible with all microSDHC,microSDXC supporting host devices7 years warrantyCopy paste speed is superb.
5.0 , 25 April 2016,This is my 4th purchase of Sandisk class 10 16GB card (Second from Amazon, First was samsung). Sandisk cards have been good quality products since many years, so nothing to mention about quality. Class 10 cards are perfect for modern day smartphones. It offers good read/write speeds. Warranty is 7 years- shows the quality of it.Nothing to mention about cloudtail as they have been genuine as always!!
4.0 , 7 April 2016,Just using the sd card  not so much about the divce but i hope itwill be good . All things are good in Amazon but one think disappointed me that is delivery. I have already purchase two or three item's from amazon but all time i need to go the place where the delivery boy present my place though exist but the boy not come in address place. This really disappoint me otherwise product or paking very good.
5.0 , 17 January 2016,I feel it is good but am not sure because I do not know how to measure it. Of course, till now I have never faced a problem except that I don't know why downloaded apps are not getting saved on it. My mobile still shows the same insufficient storage space and cannot still download any new apps. But photos and whatsapp photos and videos get saved on to this new microSD card. At least that way i'm happy.
3.0 , 25 November 2015,I ordered it for my asus zenfone 2 but  this memory card was not accepted by my phone. The massage pop ups "your memory card is automatically ejected" after every half an hour. i dont know what was problem. but when i exchange this one from my friends phones memory card( same sandisk ultra 16 gb 10x) my phone is functioning well.&amp; the my card is also functiong well in my friends phone lenovo.
5.0 , 15 April 2016,Super fast, easy to install and working perfectly. I haven't checked the read and write speeds but nonetheless it's FAST..
1.0 , 5 May 2016,Some people get the right card. Some get wrong. Don't know what is wrong. The card I received had transfer speed in kbps.
4.0 , 17 November 2015,I do not need to give a  detailed review of this product because it works exactly as stated on the Company website and carrying the brand of SanDiskJust make sure that you receive this product in the original sealed pack.If you need to purchase a 32GB MicroSD Card, you can surely buy this product and will not face any difficulties upon inserting the same in your device.
5.0 , 3 May 2016,Better choice than samsung card because sand disk provides better services. Otherwise performance is not that different.
4.0 , 16 April 2015,I got the product on time without any issues. Also working good as defined. I have recommended this to others as well. ☺
1.0 , 6 December 2015,Poor quality!The first card i received was not getting detected in cellphone as well as PC. Then I initiated replacement. The replaced (second) one is not getting detected in PC again. Now there is just one option of 'Refund'. And the refund amount is being shown as nil. How is that justified?! Didn't I pay for the card in the first place?!
2.0 , 22 November 2015,The worst memory card I've ever used. In the last 3 months it stopped working more than thrice. It showed a message "Memory card is removed unexpectedly" and I am unable to use my memory card until I switched off my phone, and remove memory card. This is happening at least once every day, I even formatted the memory card. Then it was working perfectly but not for more than 3 weeks.
5.0 , 13 October 2015,Absolutely quick delivery and the product was protected perfectly in the package.The product delivered in terms of usability; I have always trusted SanDisk microSd cards for all my cell phones. The 32gb card I purchased for my Galaxy note 3 phone works smooth. Not 40+ MB transfer speed though it gives a decent 13 MB read/write speed.All in all a great deal for 700Rs
5.0 , 25 April 2016,SanDisk Ultra MicroSDHC 32GB UHS-I Class 10  IAM BUY THE RS 529.00,(PRICE DROP)TIME.NO PROBLEM VERY USE GOOD PRODUCT TQ
4.0 , 4 April 2016,the memroy card quality is good.i am getting aprox 20mbs copying speed in my phone.the problem is if u where thinking to buy this for asus zenfone series and plz dont buy it because on my asus zenfone max memory card already unmount itself.because it doesnt fit properly  on sd slot. although i have test it in my motorola g2  and its work fine. so go for it but no asus zenfone users.
1.0 , 11 June 2016,Pathetic sd card. Just after one month of using it automatically became damaged sd card. All my pictures and data lost. How do I claim my warranty. Amazon please help. I have attached screen shot.
5.0 , 10 February 2016,Sandisk is always good and every time I preferred and trusted SANDISK. This product is really a nice one. It has speed average of 15-20 MBPS. It is slower than the other class 10 sandisk 32 GB (Red colour), but the price is low too. You can buy this product as the primary memory card of your smart phone. It also has warranty. This product supports most of the (99.99%) smart phones.
4.0 , 23 November 2015,Product have no issues except available memory found to be close to 28 GB,I am not sure where more than 3 GB space goes and whether all 32 GB SD card should have similar storage space or this one has less.I have other SD cards from SANdisk of 16 GB and I am well aware that storage space cannot be same as its mentioned but loss of close to 4 GB still a question for me
5.0 , 4 November 2015,I got this card @ Rs. 309/-. It's great performer &amp; suits its price perfectly. It is better than Samsung Evo 16 GB.
4.0 , 15 November 2015,It was 32gb as indicated, but was able to get 29 gb of storage space which is fine. Transferred 10 gb of data in about an hour which is kind of slow for first use. But I am going to test it these coming days. They also gave me Rs.430 worth of free Hungama Music/video streaming.<a class="a-link-normal" href="/SanDisk-Ultra-MicroSDHC-32GB-UHS-I-Class-10-Memory-Card-Upto-48-MB-s-Speed/dp/B010NE3QHQ">SanDisk Ultra MicroSDHC 32GB UHS-I Class 10 Memory Card (Upto 48 MB/s Speed)</a>
1.0 , 26 March 2016,Wrost memory card i hv found ever. Automatically disconnected from mobile. No working capacity. Third class piece.
5.0 , 12 March 2016,It's great to have 100 + GB storage on my phone.... I can now carry all my genuine mp3 collection and videos....!!
5.0 , 12 November 2015,Very good Memory Card. I used it for my Samsung Galaxy S5 and it worked flawlessly. Copy and Paste was little slow because of the Huge Storage but it was alright. No memory error or lost files problem. Comes with a Genuine Card Adaptor.Writing time to the card was slow than reading (Copying from card to PC).Copying Speed was 48 MB/sWriting Speed was 25 MB/s
1.0 , 28 November 2015,The 16 GB Sandisk Ultra memory card began mismatching with my Moto G @nd Gen handset after using it for only 3 weeks. The set then began non-recognizing this memory card. I had to remove it and use my old Sandisk 8 GB (non-Ultra) card, which has been working fine. I had to pay extra for greater storage as also being 'ultra'. I should be refunded my money.Sujit Basu
5.0 , 2 April 2016,Amazon is awesome...on time delivery...this SDHC card is best in performance...and also 100% original product...
5.0 , 7 April 2016,First of all I would like to thank Amazon for delivering it on time, as per the schedule.Coming to the product, it's a good product with 119GB of usable memory. I am using this card with my S7 edge and it's working alright.  Read/write speeds will not make much of a difference  unless you are into UHD or HDR videos.All in all a worthy purchase !!
5.0 , 27 February 2016,You can rely on Sandisk. This one supports Full HD and 4K video capturing/play back on my Moto X Style. amazing
5.0 , 21 September 2015,before this I was using another class 10 micro SD (from sandisk).this has better transfer rates than my previous SD card.the approximate write speed is in the range of 14-17 Mbps.this is significantly better than the 10 Mbps that I used to get.Although I did not have a chance to check the read speed I can assure you that it's better than my previous card.my old card had aa maximum speed up to 30mbps.this has 48 Mbps.Guys go for it.Only thing that bothered me was that,the product was placed in just bubble wrap.no hard box or anything was used.nevertheless nothing got damaged.
4.0 , 6 December 2015,I am this memory card for the last 1 month and I want to say that it has good writing and reading speed.Although it is not as fast as it is mentioned here but it definitely the best memory card available in the market.Overall a great memory card at this price.If you want to buy any class 10 memory card then this will best serve your purpose.No complains till now.
4.0 , 7 April 2016,Its a good product,speed is fine but not as told 48 mbps..it gives write speed of 12-16 mbps and read speed from 19-24 mbps also sandisk sd cards are better when compared to others..i have purchased sd card from samsung,transcend but returned them because they were fake and not working properly.. amazon made very fast delivery,was done on the next day of booking
4.0 , 18 December 2015,Out of 32 GB you will get 28.7 GB for you usage. 80mbps is actually the Reading Speed. Transfer Speed is also excellent. But one limitation of this product is that the adapter along with is not suitable for Desktop computers. So, You have to go for Card Reader to use this memory card in Desktop computer. Because Adapter is working  in Notebooks and Laptops only.
1.0 , 13 May 2016,disappointed..  some times it doesn't work..  i have to restart my phone every time to access this memory card. some time its working very fine. but suddenly its stop working, unable to show images, videos and everything which is in it.. to access again mmc i hv to restart my phone.. may be it happens only with me... may be its a good item, but not mine.
2.0 , 24 November 2015,After 15 days of usage, it is miss behaving in smartphone. Unexpectedly it is removing. I need to replace it
1.0 , 6 February 2016,I inserted this in Moto G3 and got initial message that it is too slow speed.  Two days later, the Android 6 message says SD card is not connected. Tried power down and re-insert, SD card shows inserted for a few minutes and then goes back to not connected error. I have not tried this in any other device. Don't know if this is product defect or piece defect.
1.0 , 8 June 2016,Dont buy it.... i have got a defective piece...Always try samsung memory card....Price is also the same....
1.0 , 13 July 2016,The number mentioned in your sms regarding the delivery agent actually belongs to someone else. Good way to start a day by getting abused at a call from a person who is actually not your agent. He might be having a bad day. In my opinion, he is right at his place. Maybe he is getting ample number of calls. Its the channel ,connecting the both, is at fault.
1.0 , 24 November 2015,Stop working within 1 month of receving/15 days of use. But return policy does not support to return
3.0 , 8 June 2016,I am using this for nokia lumia 520 and the speed was not so great as mentioned. when i put this memory card in the card reader and use it in the laptop the transfer speed was around like 17Mbps which is not a very huge speed.
5.0 , 29 November 2015,I am using this card for my Windows lumia 640 phoneIt fits perfect. I was somewhat uncomfortable to buy Sandisk memory card, as i prefer Samsung brand. but it believe me Sandisk performs is also great.The reason behind using class 10 card is to able to record and read HD video as my phone supports it. And this card does this job very well.
1.0 , 28 January 2016,I purchased this Memory Card, After few days is stops working, I am not able to write or delete any file from memory card, not able to format, Amazon not accepting return because it is more then 15 days, I am not able to contact SanDisk Service center().

4.0 , 30 April 2016,Gud but not enough storage..Only 29 gb available..But speed is gud in exchange any phone...
1.0 , 4 January 2016,Got a defective one.  Highly Disappointed.Continuously mounting/dismounting of the drive occurs automatically even if I try to copy just 2 to 3 movies to this memery card at a time. I've checked copying with 3 card readers, but the same problem persists.Ordered for a replacememt. Hope I will get a genuine piece this time.
2.0 , 9 July 2016,It may work with mobiles well but with windows tablets there seem to be some problem of frequent disconnection. (which does not happen with Samsung Evo/Strontium). May be the thickness has something to do with this (though I am not sure). I had to return and buy Samsung Evo instead. But the Seller is very good and helpful and 5* for the seller.
1.0 , 14 October 2015,The SD card that I received via Amazon is not what I expected it to be.Don't know whether the issue is with my card or not but it very frequently shows the error message SD Card unexpectedly removed even though I haven't touched the card after installing it. The previous 8 gb card that I had showed no such issue. I am sick of it!!  Very poor.😠
1.0 , 26 October 2015,I had ordered for 32 GB sd card.but disappointed tp see only 27.8 GB space available in my sd card, though my friend who had ordered with me got 31gb of space available.not satisfied with the order.Tried to contact customer service, no use yet.<a class="a-link-normal" href="/SanDisk-Ultra-MicroSDHC-32GB-UHS-I-Class-10-Memory-Card-Upto-48-MB-s-Speed/dp/B010NE3QHQ">SanDisk Ultra MicroSDHC 32GB UHS-I Class 10 Memory Card (Upto 48 MB/s Speed)</a>
3.0 , 1 July 2016,I tried it on Coolpad/android and it didnt work....the filesystem they provide on this card doesn't work with most of the mobile so you have to format it first to a recognizable one. Window doesn't provide that...download it on net and once formatted its recoginzed by android. Speed is kidda ok, it takes a split sec to display folders/files
1.0 , 8 April 2016,The card as shown doesnt met my expectation. I brought it after reading comments of other users but i think they are fake reviews. Its transfer speed is very slow &amp; my phone can support 64gb but it hangs ocassionally after inserting that card. I think amazon sent me a defected card as i brought it under offer i got from my sbi credit card.
5.0 , 18 November 2015,Received the product as expected. No surprises and the card worked without any issues. Using in my LG G4 .Copied more than 10 Gigs data,music,pictures,videos and got an average write speed of 10MBps Very happy with the product and price.i Got it for discount on Diwali deal.Satisfied with the seller.Thanks Amazon &amp; the Seller.

1.0 , 8 February 2016,I had purchased this product on 3rd October. until December 20 memory card is functioning properly.but after 2 months of purchase on inserting the card it is telling your SD card is damaged.. the card is having 10 years of warranty..instead of that also they are not ready to refund or replace the device..very worst product
1.0 , 17 June 2016,The card was damaged, it showed 32 GB capacity as well as copies data from computer but doesn't play it on the mobile or computer itself. Even after formatting it doesn't work. Totally disappointed I used it 2 months After it's delivery and became helpless as return last date has expired. Didn't expected this from Amazon.
5.0 , 25 December 2015,This card is really very good from Sandisk. I have bought this card about a month ago and using since then. The card works really well and based on my experience of using it for about a month, I have stated some features and performance of this card which I feel is accurate to the closest of my knowledge.✔✔✔✔✔PROS:✔✔✔✔✔✔ The card is a class 10 UHS-I which means it will give minimum 10 Mbps read and write speeds, which is really great. I found that this card gives about 20 Mbps write speed when I copy movies from computer to this card through my phone. The read speed is a bit less than the promised 48 Mbps. Well the read speed is about 44.8 Mbps which I am getting, this I feel is fast enough to run the 1080 p videos on my Lumia 540 without any lags.✔ The card has very good constancy in all its memory sectors/segments, which lets it copy files with almost same speed throughout. The card is also good at writing low size files with a descent speed which I found is very good compared to other Class 10 cards I have used.✔ The card comes with a 7 years warranty which I feel will never be needed due to this card's built quality from a world renowned brand SanDisk. Although if there a corruptions then it is a different matter, else this card will last a lifetime.✘✘✘✘✘CONS:✘✘✘✘✘✘ The only con is its resistances. Unlike other cards from different companies as well as SanDisk itself, the card does not come with waterproof sealing, temperature proof, X-proof and Shock proof features which I think would have been better provided for the price it takes from your wallet. This is although not needed for daily usage but I think it would have been good to have this extra features.◘◘◘◘◘◘◘◘VERDICT:◘◘◘◘◘◘◘◘Overall I would highly recommend this card to anyone looking for a 16 GB class 10 high speed card at a descent price. This a good buy if you get it at sub-300 bucks, so wait for the offer at sub-300 and then just close your eyes and grab it. This card is really good in performance for the price and stands tall in comparison to other brands at same price. I hope this review was helpful for you, please hit Yes if you found my review helpful, else if you have any questions or doubts then just comment on my review or feel free to email me at my ID stated at my Amazon profile. Thank You... Happy Shopping...

1.0 , 1 January 2016,Read speed :15MB/sWrite speed :13MB/sActual memory available to user is only 28.7 GB compared to 29.8 GB which is there for 32GB cards . SO a whole 1.1 GB is less .Better go for Samsung Evo Plus which has 29.8 GB of space with much better read and write speed.And is available for same price as this.
5.0 , 16 November 2015,Got a Made In Malaysia.Was extremely happy to see a non china one.The write speed was around 11-12mbps .Tested using A1 sd bench with Galaxy S advance.Read speeds are higher.tested on a dslr (nikon d5200)was a bit faster in clearing the buffer than the red-grey 32gb card (advertised as 30 mbps read)
5.0 , 22 March 2016,As specified in the description, the product didn't transfer files in 48mb/s. For me, it only transfer 10mb/s but the product is too nice &amp; main thing is its price in which I bought i.e Rs.499. It works properly in my Honour 4c.(5/5 star)About delivery: amazon delivered me this product too late(1/5 star)
1.0 , 21 November 2015,I purchased 3 micro SD cards , other two being Samsung and Transcend, each of class 10. I transferred the same data of around 4 GB. It took same time by Samsung and Transcend whereas it took around 3X time for transfer to sandisk. It was damn slow...I doubt if it is of class 10. don't buy this one.

1.0 , 14 November 2015,The  memory card started behaving erratically after 12 days flat. By that time the return period had already expired. I simply lost the money. The packing says the item is covered under manufacturer's warranty for 7 years. But when I checked their web site, i found that it was available within USA only.
4.0 , 21 November 2015,This disk I purchased for my oneplus  x. This product I received in time from Amazon. Product is good but need to format before putting it in oneplus x. If we insert this card without formatting oneplus do not recognise it. Out of64 gb around 59.5 gb is available for use. Overall prodigy is good.

1.0 , 2 March 2016,I tried using it in my Sony Xperia C phone, Whatever I put in this memory card, gets corrupted, apps in my phone stop working. Now it's useless. Phone says memory card damaged, need to format, did the same, fine for a second and then back to the same problem. I regret buying it. Do not buy it!!!

5.0 , 20 December 2015,Excellent quality .. (Adapter free !) I am using it in my Raspberry pi and the read write speed is very good . must buy it if you are planning for a SD card for RPi 2 as you can install a lot more packages which occupies an appreciable amount of space and still remaining a couple of GB left ..
5.0 , 2 March 2016,The product is as specified.... i have 16gb internal storage and have 11 gb available... i had installed heavy games and apps of about 10.5 gb... i transferred the entire stuff to the sd card and the apps are working fine.. no lag, no frame drops.. the read and write speed is as specified..

5.0 , 29 September 2015,Bought for Rs.700. Delivered within 4 days to calicut. Used a bubble wrap for packing. 28.77 GB available on my Lenovo K3 note. Transfered a 500mb file from internal memory to external under 30s. The same file takes over a min, on my class 4 8gb sandisk. The product appears to be genuine.
1.0 , 18 March 2016,Got worst experience with one, it is worthless to use it, slow response time .....
1.0 , 25 January 2016,I used this SD card (16 GB) with my Samsung Galaxy S3, and performance is very poor. After I put it in the Samsung S3 phone, it hangs now and then, however phone works well if I remove the SD card.I would not recommend this product if you are planning to use with Smartphone.
3.0 , 4 December 2015,Its really easy to transfer data from computer to the card, really fast. But soon after I started using it, some error occurred and my mobile asked to format it. Before formatting I connected it to laptop and transferred important files. Other than that no issues and it is working fine.

5.0 , 23 November 2015,The memory card is awesome. It gave an average write speed of 15mbps while transferring files from from laptop.Fully satisfied with the product and Amazon service.Amazon has started their own delivery service which is pretty fast. They delivered the card within 72 hrs...
4.0 , 1 November 2015,Don't be discouraged/confused by the Android logo on the packaging. This card works just fine in Windows phones with no setup or formatting required. Just slide it into the MicroSD slot and it's ready to use.Write Speed: seems a little slow, between 5 - 10 MBPSRead Speed: is good. I've transferred all my games (none are very graphics-intensive) to this card, and these apps are loading as fast and playing just as well, as they did when they were in my phone's internal memory.
5.0 , 6 April 2016,After two day use this memory card is awsm and read speed 31.95 mbps and write speed 21.34 mbps .frankly speaking i transfer large file and its transferred in a sec .32 gb memory card you get 28.96 gb.if u want good and reasonable price memory card go for it believe u never regret.
5.0 , 24 November 2015,Does the job and SanDisk are know to make good products. this is a no brainer :)
4.0 , 7 July 2016,If you need a reliable micro SD card which is reliable,for speedy data transfer and access look no far than this card.The brand is known for its quality storage cards.Class10, so ideal for using it in smart phones as took lesser time to access your memory,doesn't hang ...Go for it
4.0 , 18 November 2015,I purchased this to be used for my newly purchased Oneplus X phone. I have inserted the microSD card in the phone but its the phone that is having software problem. Some forums have suggested that I format the microSD in another form and start using right away. I will not do that.
1.0 , 22 November 2015,Delievery of the product was on time. No issues from Amazon end; however, the product turned out as a defective one. I used it with my Moto G2 and with couple of days of usage, the card was corrupted. Started showing the warning that "Memory card was removed unexpectedly'.
1.0 , 15 November 2015,Worst memory card of my life. Gave up just in few weeks of purchase. Now my mobile is always showing "memory card removed unexpectedly". Don't buy it. It's just waste of money. Also the transfer speeds are not of the class 10 level. A total fraud. Not even worth of one star. Go for the red coloured sandisk memory card, this one is a cheap piece of s***.
1.0 , 8 January 2016,I am sorry to write this.I was keeping this sd card to use it in redminote 4g.hence I kept it as spare so far.When I started uploading videos etc.  It is showing space as 29.4 gb instead of 59.4 gb wherein  on the top of the card it is printed as 64 gb.I don't understand.this seems to be a tech nical cheating. Money paid for 64 gb but available inside only 29.4 gb I.e 32 gb anybody may be sent you house to verify the card!what is the remedy for it!!!
1.0 , 14 November 2015,It worked two weeks well,after two weeks my htc mobile showing "memory card removed un expectedly" with in fraction of seconds after inserting it (or) after restarting phone.I try it for other mobiles also the same problem accured.please replace this product for me.
5.0 , 20 December 2015,Using it and all I can say I am greatly satisfied. It comes with 28 GB of free space. However I don't have a UHS enabled smartphone, so I can't enjoy that advertisted 48 MB/s.  But the card is giving 9-10 MB/s which is enough for me. Go for it if you want a larger SD card.
2.0 , 21 March 2016,Fake memory card just fake even original memory card is fully white back side
5.0 , 20 January 2016,It's too early to write on the quality of this memory card. At this stage, it has been ~15 days days, since product was delivered and no issues were found. The packing quality was okay. Some offers were also available from ScanDisk. Hope it works like this in near future.
1.0 , 10 December 2015,It's not working...... I thought to take another one in exchange.... But was working till the exchange date complete and stopped working after..... It's continuously showing like UNMOUNTED SD CARD UNEXPECTEDLY within a fraction of seconds after inserting into mobile......
1.0 , 17 November 2015,I purchased one Sandisk Micro SD 64 GB but it stopped working after 10-12 days of use. The Micro SD card is getting disconnected from tablet automatically and intermittently. If it taken out of slot and re-inserted, it starts working but again gets automatically disconnected after sometime. In same tablet my old 32GB Micro SD card works fine.
1.0 , 27 March 2016,The card doesn't work at all. Since I didn't put it to use immediately after purchase, the returning date has also elapsed.I have been cheated. Amazon has to guide me for replacement through warranty. Please guide me .... Don't let your regular customers down !!!!!
5.0 , 8 March 2016,I received the product well in time, packaging was good. And now about the memory card, the card is good, I m using it from last 25 days and no problem faced as yet. It is fast compared to other memory card, though I didn't check the actual speed. Overall a good product.
5.0 , 21 February 2016,Good product works fine. But in lenovo k4 note you should be careful in inserting the same. It need not to be inserted to the full card length inwards. i.e do not push too much until the full card is inside the slot. just the tip alone to make contact with the connector.
5.0 , 5 January 2016,Totally satisfied with the product, Able to record HD Videos flawlessly in Nokia Lumia 730 Dual SIM &amp; Microsoft Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM. Read/Write speeds are as expected, Best suited for playing games from memory card (Asphalt 8: Airborne, Modern Combat 5: Blackout, etc).
4.0 , 13 January 2016,good and economical product..if you want a better version of this go for the red one. link given below.http://www.amazon.in/SanDisk-MicroSDHC-Memory-Adapter-80mbps/dp/B010Q57T02/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452665872&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sandisk+32gb+memory+card

5.0 , 24 November 2015,Got the card in Less than 2 days, as usual quick delivery by Amazon.Transferred the files from my Phone to this SD Card. It was seamless and really fast.The Free Hungama Pro User subscription for 3 Months is worth a try.Overall a good buy.
1.0 , 20 April 2016,Very bad dont buy..... mobile handset is reading card sometime thn after sometime it get off from memory. Whn i used my old card its functions properly i thought my handset is problem but whn i used old card again thn i found this new card is not functioning properly
5.0 , 17 November 2015,This one is the best.. Before i used samsung evo 16 gb class 10 but sandisk ultra is more faster than it. Also i got it in an lightening deal so it costed me almost same as evo. Also it has an sd adaptor with it and the delivery time was also perfect. Thank u amazon.
